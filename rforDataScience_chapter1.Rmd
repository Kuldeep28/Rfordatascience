## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Chapter1
tidying means making the data consisten enough and transforming means making more variable from the initial one on which we can count or are the one which are field of intrest but not directly derivable both this process as  sum is known as data wrangling and  a very important part of data sccience so must be pad attection on it

after this we have two resource to draw knowledge or insiht from the data by visulising nd by modelling 
both have some cons and pros and this thing acta s cycle till we reach the optimal level after that all the knowledge is give as a presentation or  as a dynamic app or presentation 

Basically the data problem can occur in 3 ways:-
its just a 2;3 gb data can be easily handled by r
its 10-100 gb of data big.table
other then this may be not need that big data only need summry and all may be only so keep in mind to find the correct subset to  answer a particular  Question 
it may also be possible that the data can be act a small chunks ,which are independent and can br computed alone
so here we would use sparklr or big data

#####models are often used for exploration, and with a little care you can use visualisation for confirmation.
so here we can do data exploration,transformation ,=and modelling 
first we start with modelling and using the ggplot2 library
we will use the dataframe from ggplot2 pacakge name mpg

```{r warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)

```
now we will plot usinf ggplot library
```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg,aes(y=displ,x=hwy))+geom_point()
```
so its the first plot of the book and wel know and great even 

```{r}
 dim(mpg)
summary(mpg)
ggplot(data=mpg,aes(x=drv,y=hwy))+geom_point()
```
now after this we are going to changw the aesthetic properties of the data points, these properties could be the shape size and colour of the data point , all these can be changed inthe aesthetic part of the ggplot 

```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg,aes(x=displ,y=hwy,color=class))+geom_point()
```
in above we had used the color aesthtic to make the graph but we can use the size aesthetic too to make it a greart thing 
but in this scinario its not a great idea, infact its a bad one as we know that for this case its bbatter that all are categorical
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class))
```

as its clear that using shape aesthetic in this case is not that great,
now we are going to make thing more clear by using the alpha aesthtic use for transparency 
and shape aesthetic
```{r}
# Left
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, alpha = class))

# Right
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class))
```
so here is limitation of using the shape aesthetic it can max distinguish only 6 aes

and also behind the scene the aes function is mapping the x and y given to it and then create a visual layer 
add legends to it and create axis as per the data points we can manully do this using

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")
```
we can also use stroke aesthetic too so that
any conditional operation on aesthetic color give ys a  bollean plot 
showing which point obey that condition and which are nor t 
```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg)+geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy,color=(displ<5) ))

```
shape aesthetic can be used to change the border width 

###facet_wrap() 
can be used to make subplot based on some categorical value, sothat we can individual or cattegoricaly study these all


```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg,aes(x=displ,y=hwy))+geom_point()+facet_wrap(~class,nrow = 2)
```
here we are being able to see the plot based on each category
if we want to make grph on basis of combination of two then we use facet_grid()
both these have only few categorn so easy to view
```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg,aes(x=displ,y=hwy))+geom_point()+facet_grid(drv~cyl)

```
lets try examples too
```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg,aes(x=displ))+geom_histogram()+facet_grid(hwy~class)
```
no this plot is hactic rather than any other thing so keep in mind not o use continious var for facet_grid and is use make bin size large or the data rane must be low

we can plot same x and y with different geom function too and like for pointplot and  smooth
these are ploteed on same data but from different 

```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg)+geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy,color=(displ<5) ))
ggplot(data=mpg)+geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy ))

ggplot(data = mpg)+geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, linetype = drv))


```

so by adding layer we can make graphs containg differnt geom object but its also came up of redundancy that if we wanrt to change only 1 legend it must be changed in bot 


##solution>
try to gve mapping to at once to ggplot and after that change the filters or the relevant layers
```{r}
####the redundant way
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
######################################################### non redundant way
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) + 
  geom_smooth()

```
we can also do things like drawing line for only a particular class
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity))
```
```{r}
  seq(1,10,length.out = 5)
y<-seq(1,10,length.out = 5)

```
filter is used for filtring the data on some certain condition
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(data=mpg)+geom_point(mapping = aes(x=displ,y=hwy))
filter(mpg,cyl==8)
filter(diamonds,carat>5)
```
now if we want o represent the continious data but in context of categorical data then w will put categorical into color= cat, and also use frequency poly to reresent the data

```{r}
ggplo
```
